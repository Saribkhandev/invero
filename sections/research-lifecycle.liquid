Pre-clinical studies were intentionally conducted to better understand the biological activity and mechanisms of AG1 Next Gen — an approach that's both common and foundational in the development of nutrition research. These early insights help inform the design of human clinical trials, enhancing scientific rigor and ensuring that future studies are strategically and effectively guided. Pre-clinical trials and their results can take upwards of 8-10 months to design, implement and analyze the results.</li><li>We then partnered with independent contract research organizations (CROs) and academic institutions to ensure data collection and analysis were objective and professionally managed.</li><li>To ensure scientific integrity and ethical compliance, each human study protocol was submitted for review and approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to participant recruitment. IRB approval is a critical regulatory step that ensures the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected, and that the research is conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulations. No human study began without formal IRB approval.</li><li>We then created detailed protocols with third-party scientists (also known as principal scientists) outlining specific criteria including the study population, endpoints, duration, measurements, and statistical plan. The research partners then recruited participants according to inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in each of the individual study designs to ensure the most objective outcome for each study. Participants and the third-party researchers in the trials were \"blinded,\" meaning they did not know whether they were receiving AG1 Next Gen or the placebo. Blinded studies reduce bias and are the gold standard for high-quality clinical research.</li></ul>"
